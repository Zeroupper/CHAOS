Create step-by-step execution plans for data analysis queries.

RULES:
- Only use dataset names and column names from the DATASET SCHEMAS below.
- Each step output is saved as `step_N_result`. Reference it in later steps.
- Return EMPTY steps for unclear or non-analytical queries.
- If the query includes a "Hint:", use it to identify the correct datasets and columns.

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

### System Prompt

Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate from garmin_hr (dedicated HR sensor) and average_stress_intensity from garmin_stress (stress sensor) for user test004, by joining records based on closest timestamps within 1 second.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr dataset for uid='test004' to isolate heart rate readings from the dedicated heart rate sensor, select timestamp and heart_rate columns, save result as step_1_result (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress dataset for uid='test004' to isolate stress sensor readings, select timestamp and average_stress_intensity columns, save result as step_2_result (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Perform cross-join between step_1_result and step_2_result to create all timestamp pairs (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Filter timestamp pairs where absolute difference between hr_timestamp and stress_timestamp is <= 1 second (60 seconds in milliseconds) and select hr_row, stress_row, diff (from step_3_result)
  Step 5: Group by distinct timestamp combinations (one-to-one closest matches) using minimum time difference criterion, keep first match for each stress reading based on minimum time gap (from step_4_result)
  Step 6: Select matched heart_rate from hr_row and average_stress_intensity from stress_row for correlation calculation (from step_5_result)
  Step 7: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate and average_stress_intensity, return correlation value (from step_6_result)

## Call 10: Union

**Timestamp:** 2026-03-16T21:01:09.542965+00:00

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate from garmin_hr (dedicated HR sensor) and average_stress_intensity from garmin_stress (stress sensor) for user test004, by joining records based on closest timestamps within 1 second.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr dataset for uid='test004' to isolate heart rate readings from the dedicated heart rate sensor, select timestamp and heart_rate columns, save result as step_1_result (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress dataset for uid='test004' to isolate stress sensor readings, select timestamp and average_stress_intensity columns, save result as step_2_result (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Perform cross-join between step_1_result and step_2_result to create all timestamp pairs (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Filter timestamp pairs where absolute difference between hr_timestamp and stress_timestamp is <= 1 second (60 seconds in milliseconds) and select hr_row, stress_row, diff (from step_3_result)
  Step 5: Group by distinct timestamp combinations (one-to-one closest matches) using minimum time difference criterion, keep first match for each stress reading based on minimum time gap (from step_4_result)
  Step 6: Select matched heart_rate from hr_row and average_stress_intensity from stress_row for correlation calculation (from step_5_result)
  Step 7: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate and average_stress_intensity, return correlation value (from step_6_result)

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate from garmin_hr (dedicated HR sensor) and average_stress_intensity from garmin_stress (stress sensor) for user test004, by joining records based on closest timestamps within 1 second.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr dataset for uid='test004' to isolate heart rate readings from the dedicated heart rate sensor, select timestamp and heart_rate columns, save result as step_1_result (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress dataset for uid='test004' to isolate stress sensor readings, select timestamp and average_stress_intensity columns, save result as step_2_result (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Perform cross-join between step_1_result and step_2_result to create all timestamp pairs (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Filter timestamp pairs where absolute difference between hr_timestamp and stress_timestamp is <= 1 second (60 seconds in milliseconds) and select hr_row, stress_row, diff (from step_3_result)
  Step 5: Group by distinct timestamp combinations (one-to-one closest matches) using minimum time difference criterion, keep first match for each stress reading based on minimum time gap (from step_4_result)
  Step 6: Select matched heart_rate from hr_row and average_stress_intensity from stress_row for correlation calculation (from step_5_result)
  Step 7: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate and average_stress_intensity, return correlation value (from step_6_result)

Trying to re-merge step_1_result with step_2_result using inner join creates the same issue - timestamps won't perfectly match. The empty result indicates no rows survived the filtering, which happens when attempting to calculate diff() on already-matched timestamps or when inner merge finds no exact matches."

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate from garmin_hr (dedicated HR sensor) and average_stress_intensity from garmin_stress (stress sensor) for user test004, by joining records based on closest timestamps within 1 second.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr dataset for uid='test004' to isolate heart rate readings from the dedicated heart rate sensor, select timestamp and heart_rate columns, save result as step_1_result (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress dataset for uid='test004' to isolate stress sensor readings, select timestamp and average_stress_intensity columns, save result as step_2_result (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Perform cross-join between step_1_result and step_2_result to create all timestamp pairs (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Filter timestamp pairs where absolute difference between hr_timestamp and stress_timestamp is <= 1 second (60 seconds in milliseconds) and select hr_row, stress_row, diff (from step_3_result)
  Step 5: Group by distinct timestamp combinations (one-to-one closest matches) using minimum time difference criterion, keep first match for each stress reading based on minimum time gap (from step_4_result)
  Step 6: Select matched heart_rate from hr_row and average_stress_intensity from stress_row for correlation calculation (from step_5_result)
  Step 7: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate and average_stress_intensity, return correlation value (from step_6_result)

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate from garmin_hr (dedicated HR sensor) and average_stress_intensity from garmin_stress (stress sensor) for user test004, by joining records based on closest timestamps within 1 second.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr dataset for uid='test004' to isolate heart rate readings from the dedicated heart rate sensor, select timestamp and heart_rate columns, save result as step_1_result (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress dataset for uid='test004' to isolate stress sensor readings, select timestamp and average_stress_intensity columns, save result as step_2_result (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Perform cross-join between step_1_result and step_2_result to create all timestamp pairs (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Filter timestamp pairs where absolute difference between hr_timestamp and stress_timestamp is <= 1 second (60 seconds in milliseconds) and select hr_row, stress_row, diff (from step_3_result)
  Step 5: Group by distinct timestamp combinations (one-to-one closest matches) using minimum time difference criterion, keep first match for each stress reading based on minimum time gap (from step_4_result)
  Step 6: Select matched heart_rate from hr_row and average_stress_intensity from stress_row for correlation calculation (from step_5_result)
  Step 7: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate and average_stress_intensity, return correlation value (from step_6_result)

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate from garmin_hr (dedicated HR sensor) and average_stress_intensity from garmin_stress (stress sensor) for user test004, by joining records based on closest timestamps within 1 second.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr dataset for uid='test004' to isolate heart rate readings from the dedicated heart rate sensor, select timestamp and heart_rate columns, save result as step_1_result (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress dataset for uid='test004' to isolate stress sensor readings, select timestamp and average_stress_intensity columns, save result as step_2_result (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Perform cross-join between step_1_result and step_2_result to create all timestamp pairs (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Filter timestamp pairs where absolute difference between hr_timestamp and stress_timestamp is <= 1 second (60 seconds in milliseconds) and select hr_row, stress_row, diff (from step_3_result)
  Step 5: Group by distinct timestamp combinations (one-to-one closest matches) using minimum time difference criterion, keep first match for each stress reading based on minimum time gap (from step_4_result)
  Step 6: Select matched heart_rate from hr_row and average_stress_intensity from stress_row for correlation calculation (from step_5_result)
  Step 7: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate and average_stress_intensity, return correlation value (from step_6_result)

### System Prompt

Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate from garmin_hr (dedicated HR sensor) and average_stress_intensity from garmin_stress (stress sensor) for user test004, by joining records based on closest timestamps within 1 second.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr dataset for uid='test004' to isolate heart rate readings from the dedicated heart rate sensor, select timestamp and heart_rate columns, save result as step_1_result (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress dataset for uid='test004' to isolate stress sensor readings, select timestamp and average_stress_intensity columns, save result as step_2_result (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Perform cross-join between step_1_result and step_2_result to create all timestamp pairs (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Filter timestamp pairs where absolute difference between hr_timestamp and stress_timestamp is <= 1 second (60 seconds in milliseconds) and select hr_row, stress_row, diff (from step_3_result)
  Step 5: Group by distinct timestamp combinations (one-to-one closest matches) using minimum time difference criterion, keep first match for each stress reading based on minimum time gap (from step_4_result)
  Step 6: Select matched heart_rate from hr_row and average_stress_intensity from stress_row for correlation calculation (from step_5_result)
  Step 7: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate and average_stress_intensity, return correlation value (from step_6_result)

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr dataset for uid='test004' to isolate heart rate readings from the dedicated heart rate sensor, select timestamp and heart_rate columns, save result as step_1_result (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress dataset for uid='test004' to isolate stress sensor readings, select timestamp and average_stress_intensity columns, save result as step_2_result (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Perform cross-join between step_1_result and step_2_result to create all timestamp pairs (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Filter timestamp pairs where absolute difference between hr_timestamp and stress_timestamp is <= 1 second (60 seconds in milliseconds) and select hr_row, stress_row, diff (from step_3_result)
  Step 5: Group by distinct timestamp combinations (one-to-one closest matches) using minimum time difference criterion, keep first match for each stress reading based on minimum time gap (from step_4_result)
  Step 6: Select matched heart_rate from hr_row and average_stress_intensity from stress_row for correlation calculation (from step_5_result)
  Step 7: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate and average_stress_intensity, return correlation value (from step_6_result)

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate from garmin_hr (dedicated HR sensor) and average_stress_intensity from garmin_stress (stress sensor) for user test004, by joining records based on closest timestamps within 1 second.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr dataset for uid='test004' to isolate heart rate readings from the dedicated heart rate sensor, select timestamp and heart_rate columns, save result as step_1_result (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress dataset for uid='test004' to isolate stress sensor readings, select timestamp and average_stress_intensity columns, save result as step_2_result (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Perform cross-join between step_1_result and step_2_result to create all timestamp pairs (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Filter timestamp pairs where absolute difference between hr_timestamp and stress_timestamp is <= 1 second (60 seconds in milliseconds) and select hr_row, stress_row, diff (from step_3_result)
  Step 5: Group by distinct timestamp combinations (one-to-one closest matches) using minimum time difference criterion, keep first match for each stress reading based on minimum time gap (from step_4_result)
  Step 6: Select matched heart_rate from hr_row and average_stress_intensity from stress_row for correlation calculation (from step_5_result)
  Step 7: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate and average_stress_intensity, return correlation value (from step_6_result)

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.
```

Based on the step results, provide the final answer.

RULES:
- "answer" must directly answer the query. State the result value first, optionally followed by one short sentence of context (e.g. "0.611 (Pearson correlation from 89 paired observations).").
- Use the value from the last computed step as the definitive result. Do NOT recompute or second-guess code correctness.
- Only answer "N/A" if a crucial step failed or returned a null/NaN value.
- "supporting_evidence" should list the key step results that support the answer.

Raw answer: Correlation cannot be calculated. The garmin_stress dataset contains 17283 records for user test004, but the average_stress_intensity column has 100% null values (nulls=17283). All other stress-related columns (heart_rate, body_battery, body_battery_status) also contain null values. The dedicated heart rate sensor (garmin_hr) has valid readings, but there is no valid stress data to correlate with.

Plan Understanding: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate from garmin_hr (dedicated HR sensor) and average_stress_intensity from garmin_stress (stress sensor) for user test004, by joining records based on closest timestamps within 1 second.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr dataset for uid='test004' to isolate heart rate readings from the dedicated heart rate sensor, select timestamp and heart_rate columns, save result as step_1_result (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress dataset for uid='test004' to isolate stress sensor readings, select timestamp and average_stress_intensity columns, save result as step_2_result (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Perform cross-join between step_1_result and step_2_result to create all timestamp pairs (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Filter timestamp pairs where absolute difference between hr_timestamp and stress_timestamp is <= 1 second (60 seconds in milliseconds) and select hr_row, stress_row, diff (from step_3_result)
  Step 5: Group by distinct timestamp combinations (one-to-one closest matches) using minimum time difference criterion, keep first match for each stress reading based on minimum time gap (from step_4_result)
  Step 6: Select matched heart_rate from hr_row and average_stress_intensity from stress_row for correlation calculation (from step_5_result)
  Step 7: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate and average_stress_intensity, return correlation value (from step_6_result)

Answer: N/A (Correlation cannot be calculated as average_stress_intensity column has 100% null values).
