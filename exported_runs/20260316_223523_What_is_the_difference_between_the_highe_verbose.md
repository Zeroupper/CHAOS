Create step-by-step execution plans for data analysis queries.

RULES:
- Only use dataset names and column names from the DATASET SCHEMAS below.
- Each step output is saved as `step_N_result`. Reference it in later steps.
- Return EMPTY steps for unclear or non-analytical queries.
- If the query includes a "Hint:", use it to identify the correct datasets and columns.

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Please verify the following answer against the execution plan:

Plan Understanding: This query requires finding the maximum and minimum heart rate values from the heart rate dataset for a specific user (test004), then calculating the difference between them.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter the garmin_hr dataset for uid = 'test004' to get all heart rate records for this user (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Calculate the maximum heart_rate value from the filtered data (from step_1_result)
  Step 3: Calculate the minimum heart_rate value from the filtered data (from step_1_result)
  Step 4: Compute the difference by subtracting min heart_rate from max heart_rate (from step_2_result, step_3_result)

Answer: 107.0 (the difference between maximum and minimum heart rate for user test004)

Evidence (executed computations):

  Step 1:
    Code executed: result = garmin_hr[garmin_hr['uid'] == 'test004']

  Step 2:

  Step 3:
    Code executed: # Filter out invalid/negative values from heart_rate column
# Check if -1.0 is used as a placeholder for missing/null values
filtered_df = step_1_result[step_1_result['heart_rate'] > 0]
min_heart_rate = filtered_df['heart_rate'].min()
result = min_heart_rate
    Result: 48.0

  Step 4:
    Code executed: result = step_2_result - step_3_result
    Result: 107.0

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
1. Does the answer match what the plan's steps describe?
2. Did any step encounter an error that was never resolved by a later execution?
3. Do the results seem like legitimate answers, or do they indicate abnormalities (e.g. negative values where impossible, NaN, empty)?
4. Does the final answer contain an ACTUAL COMPUTED VALUE (not a guess or hallucination)?
