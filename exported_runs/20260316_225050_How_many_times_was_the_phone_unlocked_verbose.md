Create step-by-step execution plans for data analysis queries.

RULES:
- Only use dataset names and column names from the DATASET SCHEMAS below.
- Each step output is saved as `step_N_result`. Reference it in later steps.
- Return EMPTY steps for unclear or non-analytical queries.
- If the query includes a "Hint:", use it to identify the correct datasets and columns.

Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Based on the step results, provide the final answer.

RULES:
- "answer" must directly answer the query. State the result value first, optionally followed by one short sentence of context (e.g. "0.611 (Pearson correlation from 89 paired observations).").
- Use the value from the last computed step as the definitive result. Do NOT recompute or second-guess code correctness.
- Only answer "N/A" if a crucial step failed or returned a null/NaN value.
- "supporting_evidence" should list the key step results that support the answer.

Query: The user wants to count the number of phone unlock events. This requires querying the ios_lock_unlock dataset and filtering/counting records where the phone was unlocked (lock_state indicating unlock state).

Step results:
Previous executions:

Step 1:  Code:
```
result = ios_lock_unlock.head(10)
```
Result: {"_id":{"0":"68afe00d6ce213cee766af30","1":"68afe00d6ce213cee766af32","2":"68afe00d6ce213cee766af33","3":"68afe00d6ce213cee766af34","4":"68afe00d6ce213cee766af45","5":"68afe00d6ce213cee766af47","6":"6... (truncated, 726 chars total)

Step 2:  Code:
```
result = len(ios_lock_unlock[ios_lock_unlock['lock_state'] == 0])
```
Result: 336

Step 0:  Code:
```

```
Result: Steps [3] were never executed.

Raw answer: There are 336 phone unlock events in the ios_lock_unlock dataset where lock_state equals 0 (indicating unlocked state).
```

### System Prompt

```
Verify an answer against its execution plan. The plan defines what should be computed.

RULES:
- If gaps is not empty, is_complete must be false.
- If issues is not empty, is_accurate must be false.
- If is_complete or is_accurate is false, recommendation must be "reject" or "needs_review".

Please verify the following answer against the execution plan:

Plan Understanding: The user wants to count the number of phone unlock events. This requires querying the ios_lock_unlock dataset and filtering/counting records where the phone was unlocked (lock_state indicating unlock state).

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Load the ios_lock_unlock dataset to access lock/unlock event records (from ios_lock_unlock)
  Step 2: Filter records where lock_state equals 0 (indicating phone unlocked state) (from step_1_result)
  Step 3: Count the total number of filtered unlock events (from step_2_result)

Answer: 336 phone unlock events (where lock_state equals 0 in the ios_lock_unlock dataset)

Evidence (executed computations):

  Step 1:
    Code executed: result = ios_lock_unlock.head(10)
    Result: {"_id":{"0":"68afe00d6ce213cee766af30","1":"68afe00d6ce213cee766af32","2":"68afe00d6ce213cee766af33","3":"68afe00d6ce213cee766af34","4":"68afe00d6ce213cee766af45","5":"68afe00d6ce213cee766af47","6":"6... (truncated, 726 chars total)

  Step 2:
    Code executed: result = len(ios_lock_unlock[ios_lock_unlock['lock_state'] == 0])
    Result: 336

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
1. Does the answer match what the plan's steps describe?
2. Did any step encounter an error that was never resolved by a later execution?
3. Do the results seem like legitimate answers, or do they indicate abnormalities (e.g. negative values where impossible, NaN, empty)?
4. Does the final answer contain an ACTUAL COMPUTED VALUE (not a guess or hallucination)?

Evaluate this answer and provide a verification report as JSON.

Step 1 loaded the ios_lock_unlock dataset and Step 2 filtered and counted records where lock_state equals 0, resulting in 336 unlock events.
