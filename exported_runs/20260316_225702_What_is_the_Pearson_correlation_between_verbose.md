Create step-by-step execution plans for data analysis queries.

RULES:
- Only use dataset names and column names from the DATASET SCHEMAS below.
- Each step output is saved as `step_N_result`. Reference it in later steps.
- Return EMPTY steps for unclear or non-analytical queries.
- If the query includes a "Hint:", use it to identify the correct datasets and columns.

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate from garmin_hr (dedicated HR sensor) and heart_rate from garmin_stress (stress sensor) for user test004, matching records by timestamp within 1 second tolerance.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr where uid = 'test004' to get dedicated heart rate sensor readings (from garmin_hr)

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate from garmin_hr (dedicated HR sensor) and heart_rate from garmin_stress (stress sensor) for user test004, matching records by timestamp within 1 second tolerance.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr where uid = 'test004' to get dedicated heart rate sensor readings (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress where uid = 'test004' and heart_rate is not null to get stress sensor heart rate readings (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Join step_1_result and step_2_result on closest timestamp within 1 second tolerance, keeping both heart_rate values (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between garmin_hr.heart_rate and garmin_stress.heart_rate from step_3_result (from step_3_result)

- "answer" must directly answer the query. State the result value first, optionally followed by one short sentence of context (e.g. "0.611 (Pearson correlation from 89 paired observations).").
- Use the value from the last computed step as the definitive result. Do NOT recompute or second-guess code correctness.
- Only answer "N/A" if a crucial step failed or returned a null/NaN value.
- "supporting_evidence" should list the key step results that support the answer.

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
1. Does the answer match what the plan's steps describe?
2. Did any step encounter an error that was never resolved by a later execution?
3. Do the results seem like legitimate answers, or do they indicate abnormalities (e.g. negative values where impossible, NaN, empty)?
4. Does the final answer contain an ACTUAL COMPUTED VALUE (not a guess or hallucination)?

Evaluate this answer and provide a verification report as JSON.
