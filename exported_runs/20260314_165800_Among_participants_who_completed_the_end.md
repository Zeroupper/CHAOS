## Plan

**Understanding:** This query requires comparing screen unlock behavior between depressed and non-depressed participants. I need to: (1) Use dep_endterm dataset to identify participants with depression status, (2) Use screen dataset to get 14-day rolling screen unlock counts (f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist), (3) Merge datasets on pid, (4) Calculate mean unlock count for each group, (5) Compute the difference.

| Step | Action | Source |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Load dep_endterm dataset and filter to keep only pid and dep columns for participants with depression assessment | dep_endterm |
| 2 | Load screen dataset and select pid, date, and f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist columns | screen |
| 3 | Merge step_1_result (dep_endterm) with step_2_result (screen) on pid to associate depression status with screen unlock data | step_1_result, step_2_result |
| 4 | Filter step_3_result to separate depressed participants (dep=True) and calculate mean of f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist | step_3_result |
| 5 | Filter step_3_result to separate non-depressed participants (dep=False) and calculate mean of f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist | step_3_result |
| 6 | Calculate difference as (depressed mean from step_4 minus not-depressed mean from step_5) and round to 4 decimal places | step_4_result, step_5_result |

**Sensemaker Request:** Merge step_1_result (dep_endterm) with step_2_result (screen) on pid to associate depression status with screen unlock data

*Reasoning:* Step 1 and Step 2 are completed. Step 3 needs to merge the depression status data (step_1_result) with the screen unlock data (step_2_result) on the pid column. This will allow us to associate each screen unlock measurement with the participant's depression status.

**Sensemaker Request:** Filter step_3_result to keep only depressed participants (dep=True) and calculate mean of f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist column

*Reasoning:* Step 4 is the next pending step. I need to filter the merged dataset for depressed participants and compute the mean unlock count for this group.

**Info Seeker Response:**

- **Source:** step_3_result
- **Success:** Yes

```python
result = step_3_result[step_3_result['dep'] == True]['f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist'].mean()
```

**Result:**
```
1264.247408982195
```


**Sensemaker Request:** Filter step_3_result to keep only non-depressed participants (dep=False) and calculate mean of f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist column

*Reasoning:* Step 4 calculated the mean unlock count for depressed participants. Now I need to execute Step 5 to calculate the mean for non-depressed participants (dep=False) so I can then compute the difference in Step 6.

**Info Seeker Response:**

- **Source:** step_3_result
- **Success:** Yes

```python
result = step_3_result[step_3_result['dep'] == False]['f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist'].mean()
```

**Result:**
```
1103.3009210327646
```


**Sensemaker Request:** Calculate difference as (depressed mean from step_4 minus non-depressed mean from step_5) and round to 4 decimal places

*Reasoning:* Step 6 is the final calculation step. I need to compute the difference between the mean unlock count for depressed participants (1264.247408982195 from step_4_result) and non-depressed participants (1103.3009210327646 from step_5_result), then round to 4 decimal places.

**Info Seeker Response:**

- **Source:** step_4_result, step_5_result
- **Success:** Yes

```python
result = round(step_4_result - step_5_result, 4)
```

**Result:**
```
160.9465
```

### Sensemaker Complete

## Final Answer

```
160.9465 (depressed participants had 160.9465 higher mean 14-day rolling screen unlock counts than non-depressed participants).
```

## Verification

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Complete | Yes |
| Accurate | Yes |
| Confidence | 95% |
| Recommendation | APPROVE |

**Summary:** The answer correctly follows the execution plan. All steps were properly executed: depression status was merged with screen unlock data, group means were calculated accurately, and the difference was computed and rounded as specified. The final value 160.9465 matches the computed result from the evidence.
