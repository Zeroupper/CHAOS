Create step-by-step execution plans for data analysis queries.

RULES:
- Only use dataset names and column names from the DATASET SCHEMAS below.
- Each step output is saved as `step_N_result`. Reference it in later steps.
- Return EMPTY steps for unclear or non-analytical queries.
- If the query includes a "Hint:", use it to identify the correct datasets and columns.

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: The query requires calculating Pearson correlation between heart_rate values from two Garmin datasets (garmin_hr and garmin_stress) for user 'test004'. Both datasets have heart_rate columns. Readings need to be matched by closest timestamp within a 1-second window.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr dataset for uid = 'test004' and select uid, timestamp, heart_rate columns (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress dataset for uid = 'test004' and select uid, timestamp, heart_rate columns (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Align the two datasets by timestamp - match records where timestamps are within 1 second of each other (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Extract heart_rate values from aligned datasets - HR from garmin_hr and HR from garmin_stress (from step_3_result)
  Step 5: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between the two heart_rate columns (from step_4_result)

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: The query requires calculating Pearson correlation between heart_rate values from two Garmin datasets (garmin_hr and garmin_stress) for user 'test004'. Both datasets have heart_rate columns. Readings need to be matched by closest timestamp within a 1-second window.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr dataset for uid = 'test004' and select uid, timestamp, heart_rate columns (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress dataset for uid = 'test004' and select uid, timestamp, heart_rate columns (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Align the two datasets by timestamp - match records where timestamps are within 1 second of each other (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Extract heart_rate values from aligned datasets - HR from garmin_hr and HR from garmin_stress (from step_3_result)
  Step 5: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between the two heart_rate columns (from step_4_result)

Step States:

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: The query requires calculating Pearson correlation between heart_rate values from two Garmin datasets (garmin_hr and garmin_stress) for user 'test004'. Both datasets have heart_rate columns. Readings need to be matched by closest timestamp within a 1-second window.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr dataset for uid = 'test004' and select uid, timestamp, heart_rate columns (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress dataset for uid = 'test004' and select uid, timestamp, heart_rate columns (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Align the two datasets by timestamp - match records where timestamps are within 1 second of each other (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Extract heart_rate values from aligned datasets - HR from garmin_hr and HR from garmin_stress (from step_3_result)
  Step 5: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between the two heart_rate columns (from step_4_result)

Step States:

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Based on the step results, provide the final answer.

RULES:
- "answer" must directly answer the query. State the result value first, optionally followed by one short sentence of context (e.g. "0.611 (Pearson correlation from 89 paired observations).").
- Use the value from the last computed step as the definitive result. Do NOT recompute or second-guess code correctness.
- Only answer "N/A" if a crucial step failed or returned a null/NaN value.
- "supporting_evidence" should list the key step results that support the answer.

Query: The query requires calculating Pearson correlation between heart_rate values from two Garmin datasets (garmin_hr and garmin_stress) for user 'test004'. Both datasets have heart_rate columns. Readings need to be matched by closest timestamp within a 1-second window.

Please verify the following answer against the execution plan:

Plan Understanding: The query requires calculating Pearson correlation between heart_rate values from two Garmin datasets (garmin_hr and garmin_stress) for user 'test004'. Both datasets have heart_rate columns. Readings need to be matched by closest timestamp within a 1-second window.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr dataset for uid = 'test004' and select uid, timestamp, heart_rate columns (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress dataset for uid = 'test004' and select uid, timestamp, heart_rate columns (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Align the two datasets by timestamp - match records where timestamps are within 1 second of each other (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Extract heart_rate values from aligned datasets - HR from garmin_hr and HR from garmin_stress (from step_3_result)
  Step 5: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between the two heart_rate columns (from step_4_result)

Answer: 0.899 (Pearson correlation from 353,084 paired heart_rate observations between garmin_hr and garmin_stress datasets for user 'test004', matched within 1-second timestamp window).

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
1. Does the answer match what the plan's steps describe?
2. Did any step encounter an error that was never resolved by a later execution?
3. Do the results seem like legitimate answers, or do they indicate abnormalities (e.g. negative values where impossible, NaN, empty)?
4. Does the final answer contain an ACTUAL COMPUTED VALUE (not a guess or hallucination)?
