Create step-by-step execution plans for data analysis queries.

RULES:
- Only use dataset names and column names from the DATASET SCHEMAS below.
- Each step output is saved as `step_N_result`. Reference it in later steps.
- Return EMPTY steps for unclear or non-analytical queries.
- If the query includes a "Hint:", use it to identify the correct datasets and columns.

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: The user wants to calculate Pearson correlation between two heart rate measurements: one from garmin_hr (dedicated HR sensor) and one from garmin_stress (stress sensor). Both datasets contain heart_rate and timestamp columns. Need to filter for user test004, align records within 1 second timestamp window, then compute correlation.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Load garmin_hr dataset and filter for uid='test004', select timestamp and heart_rate columns (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Load garmin_stress dataset and filter for uid='test004', select timestamp and heart_rate columns (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Align heart rate readings from both datasets by matching timestamps within 1 second window, keeping pairs where timestamps are closest (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between the aligned heart_rate values from both sensors (from step_3_result)

## Call 10: Union

**Timestamp:** 2026-03-16T21:51:37.270372+00:00

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: The user wants to calculate Pearson correlation between two heart rate measurements: one from garmin_hr (dedicated HR sensor) and one from garmin_stress (stress sensor). Both datasets contain heart_rate and timestamp columns. Need to filter for user test004, align records within 1 second timestamp window, then compute correlation.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Load garmin_hr dataset and filter for uid='test004', select timestamp and heart_rate columns (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Load garmin_stress dataset and filter for uid='test004', select timestamp and heart_rate columns (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Align heart rate readings from both datasets by matching timestamps within 1 second window, keeping pairs where timestamps are closest (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between the aligned heart_rate values from both sensors (from step_3_result)

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.
```

Based on the step results, provide the final answer.

RULES:
- "answer" must directly answer the query. State the result value first, optionally followed by one short sentence of context (e.g. "0.611 (Pearson correlation from 89 paired observations).").
- Use the value from the last computed step as the definitive result. Do NOT recompute or second-guess code correctness.
- Only answer "N/A" if a crucial step failed or returned a null/NaN value.
- "supporting_evidence" should list the key step results that support the answer.

Query: The user wants to calculate Pearson correlation between two heart rate measurements: one from garmin_hr (dedicated HR sensor) and one from garmin_stress (stress sensor). Both datasets contain heart_rate and timestamp columns. Need to filter for user test004, align records within 1 second timestamp window, then compute correlation.

Please verify the following answer against the execution plan:

Plan Understanding: The user wants to calculate Pearson correlation between two heart rate measurements: one from garmin_hr (dedicated HR sensor) and one from garmin_stress (stress sensor). Both datasets contain heart_rate and timestamp columns. Need to filter for user test004, align records within 1 second timestamp window, then compute correlation.

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Load garmin_hr dataset and filter for uid='test004', select timestamp and heart_rate columns (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Load garmin_stress dataset and filter for uid='test004', select timestamp and heart_rate columns (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Align heart rate readings from both datasets by matching timestamps within 1 second window, keeping pairs where timestamps are closest (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between the aligned heart_rate values from both sensors (from step_3_result)
