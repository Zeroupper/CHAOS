## Plan

**Understanding:** Compare the average screen unlock counts (specifically f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist) between depressed (dep=True) and not-depressed (dep=False) participants from the dep_endterm dataset

| Step | Action | Source |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Extract participants from dep_endterm dataset who completed end-of-term depression assessment, capturing pid and dep status | dep_endterm |
| 2 | Join screen dataset with dep_endterm dataset on pid to associate screen metrics with depression status | screen |
| 3 | Extract f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist column from screen-data as the screen unlock count metric | screen |
| 4 | Calculate mean of screen unlock count (f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist) for depressed participants where dep=True | Combined |
| 5 | Calculate mean of screen unlock count (f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist) for not-depressed participants where dep=False | Combined |
| 6 | Subtract not-depressed mean from depressed mean and round result to 4 decimal places | Combined |

**Sensemaker Request:** merge dep_endterm result with screen dataset on pid column using left join to associate screen metrics with depression status

#### Data Quality Review Proposed

- **Affected Step:** 3
- **Issue:** Column f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist is returning all null values. Looking at step_2_result structure, the column names after merge may be different due to how the join was performed.
- **Proposed Fix:** Instead of trying to access the column directly on the step_2_result object which returned Unnamed: 0_x as the index, we should properly extract the screen measurement column from the merged dataframe. We need to check what columns actually exist in step_2_result and ensure we're accessing the screen unlock count from the joined data correctly. The column might have been renamed during the merge operation.
- **Reasoning:** Step 3 returned null values for all entries, but the schema shows f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist exists in the screen dataset with float64 values (nulls=3039 out of 14260). The issue is likely that the merge in Step 2 created a dataframe where the column structure isn't being accessed correctly in Step 3. We need to properly access the joined dataframe (step_2_result) and extract the screen unlock count column with proper column name checking.

**User Decision:** approve

#### Data Quality Review Proposed

- **Affected Step:** 3
- **Issue:** Step 3 failed because attempting to select 1134 screen-related columns at once caused an invalid JSON error. The merged dataframe has too many columns to process in a single selection operation.
- **Proposed Fix:** Instead of selecting all screen columns at once, select only the 'pid' and 'f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist' columns directly from step_2_result.
- **Reasoning:** The dataset schema confirms that 'f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist' exists in the screen dataset. We should only extract this specific column along with pid to avoid the column limit issue. Let's re-run Step 3 with a targeted column selection.

**User Decision:** approve

**Sensemaker Request:** Calculate mean of f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist for depressed participants where dep=True from the step_3_result dataframe

*Reasoning:* Need to filter step_3_result for rows where dep=True and compute mean of screen unlock count metric

**Info Seeker Response:**

- **Source:** query
- **Success:** Yes

```python
import pandas as pd

# Join step_1_result with step_3_result on pid
merged = step_1_result.merge(step_3_result, on='pid', how='inner')

# Filter for depressed participants (dep=True)
depressed = merged[merged['dep'] == True]

# Calculate mean of the target column
result = depressed['f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist'].mean()
```

**Result:**
```
1264.247408982195
```


**Sensemaker Request:** Calculate mean of f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist for not-depressed participants where dep=False from step_2_result dataframe

*Reasoning:* Step 5 is pending and needs to calculate the mean screen unlock count for not-depressed participants (dep=False) from the combined dataframe. I'll use step_2_result (merged dep_endterm and screen datasets) to filter and calculate.

**Info Seeker Response:**

- **Source:** python
- **Success:** No

```python
merged = step_3_result.merge(step_1_result[['pid', 'dep']], on='pid')\nresult = merged[merged['dep'] == False]['f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist'].mean()
```

**Result:**
```
Code execution failed: unexpected character after line continuation character (<string>, line 1)
```


**Sensemaker Request:** Calculate mean of f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist for not-depressed participants where dep=False from step_2_result dataframe

*Reasoning:* Step 5 failed due to line continuation syntax error. Need to recalculate the mean for not-depressed participants using step_2_result which already contains the merged data from both datasets.

**Info Seeker Response:**

- **Source:** user
- **Success:** Yes

```python
import pandas as pd

# Filter for non-depressed participants using step_1_result and step_2_result
# First, merge step_1_result with step_2_result on pid to get dep information
merged = step_1_result.merge(step_2_result, on='pid', how='inner')

# This will give us step_2_result columns for participants where dep=False
# But we need to also join with step_3_result for the column we want to mean
dep_not = step_1_result[step_1_result['dep'] == False]
dep_not_with_screen = dep_not.merge(step_3_result, on='pid', how='inner')

# Calculate the mean of the specific column
result = dep_not_with_screen['f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist'].mean()
```

**Result:**
```
1103.3009210327646
```


**Sensemaker Request:** Calculate the difference between depressed mean (1264.247408982195) and not-depressed mean (1103.3009210327646) for screen unlock counts, then round to 4 decimal places

*Reasoning:* Step 6 is the final calculation step. I need to subtract the not-depressed mean from the depressed mean and round to 4 decimal places to get the final comparison result.

**Info Seeker Response:**

- **Source:** step_analysis
- **Success:** Yes

```python
result = round(step_4_result - step_5_result, 4)
```

**Result:**
```
160.9465
```

### Sensemaker Complete

## Final Answer

```
1264.25 average screen unlock count for depressed participants vs 1103.30 for not-depressed participants, with depressed participants showing 160.95 higher average (f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist from dep_endterm dataset).
```

## Verification

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Complete | Yes |
| Accurate | Yes |
| Confidence | 95% |
| Recommendation | APPROVE |

**Gaps:**
- Step 5 initial execution attempt failed with line continuation character error before being resolved

**Issues:**
- Step 5 required two execution attempts - first attempt failed before correction

**Summary:** Verification completed successfully. All plan steps were executed (after Step 5 correction). Depressed mean: 1264.25, Not-depressed mean: 1103.30, Difference: 160.95 (matches computed 160.9465 rounded to 2 decimal places). Minor initial execution error in Step 5 was resolved.
