## Plan

**Understanding:** This query asks for the Pearson correlation coefficient between perceived stress levels measured by PSS-10 items in the pre-study survey and sleep duration metrics from the sleep tracking data. I need to join the 'pre' and 'sleep' datasets on pid, ensuring only participants appear in both, then calculate correlation between PSS_10items_PRE and the average 14-day rolling sleep duration column (f_slp:fitbit_sleep_summary_rapids_avgdurationasleepmain:14dhist). The final correlation coefficient should be rounded to 4 decimal places.

| Step | Action | Source |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Load pre dataset and select columns pid and PSS_10items_PRE, dropping null values in PSS_10items_PRE | pre |
| 2 | Load sleep dataset and select columns pid and f_slp:fitbit_sleep_summary_rapids_avgdurationasleepmain:14dhist, dropping null values in sleep duration column | sleep |
| 3 | Merge pre and sleep datasets on pid using inner join to keep only participants present in both datasets, create step_3_result | step_1_result, step_2_result |
| 4 | Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between PSS_10items_PRE and f_slp:fitbit_sleep_summary_rapids_avgdurationasleepmain:14dhist from step_3_result, create step_4_result | step_3_result |
| 5 | Round the correlation coefficient in step_4_result to 4 decimal places and return as final result | step_4_result |

## Execution Log


**Sensemaker Request:** Load the 'pre' dataset and select columns 'pid' and 'PSS_10items_PRE', dropping null values in PSS_10items_PRE column

*Reasoning:* This is the first step in the plan. We need to load the pre-study survey data and extract the participant ID and stress scores, removing any records with missing stress scores before proceeding to merge with sleep data.

**Info Seeker Response:**

- **Source:** pre
- **Success:** Yes

```python
result = pre[['pid', 'PSS_10items_PRE']].dropna(subset=['PSS_10items_PRE'])
```
