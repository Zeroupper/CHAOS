## Plan

**Understanding:** This query requires comparing screen unlock behavior between depressed and non-depressed participants using end-term depression assessment data. Need to join dep_endterm (for depression status) with screen (for unlock count), group by depression flag, calculate means, and compute the difference.

| Step | Action | Source |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Load dep_endterm dataset and filter for participants with depression assessment (dep column exists) | dep_endterm |
| 2 | Extract pid and dep status from dep_endterm, creating step_2_result with participant depression flags | step_1_result |
| 3 | Load screen dataset and select pid, date, and f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist column | screen |
| 4 | Join screen data with dep_endterm depression status on pid to create step_4_result | step_3_result, step_2_result |
| 5 | Group step_4_result by dep status and calculate mean of f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist for each group | step_4_result |
| 6 | Calculate difference: depressed mean minus not-depressed mean from step_5_result | step_5_result |
| 7 | Round the difference to 4 decimal places and return final result | step_6_result |

## Execution Log


**Sensemaker Request:** Load dep_endterm dataset and filter for participants where the dep column exists (not null/empty)

*Reasoning:* Starting the analysis by loading the depression end-term assessment data. This is the first step in the plan to identify participants with depression status for comparison.

**Info Seeker Response:**

- **Source:** dep_endterm
- **Success:** No

```python
result = dep_endterm[dep_endterm['dep'].notnull()
```

**Result:**
```
Code execution failed: '[' was never closed (<string>, line 1)
```


**Sensemaker Request:** Load dep_endterm dataset and filter for participants where the dep column exists (not null/empty). Fix the syntax error by adding the missing closing bracket.

*Reasoning:* Step 1 failed due to a syntax error - missing closing bracket ']'. The code should be: result = dep_endterm[dep_endterm['dep'].notnull()]. I need to re-execute with the corrected code.

**Info Seeker Response:**

- **Source:** dep_endterm
- **Success:** Yes

```python
result = dep_endterm[dep_endterm['dep'].notna() & (dep_endterm['dep'] != '')]
```

**Result:**
```

**Sensemaker Request:** Join screen data (step_3_result) with depression status (step_2_result) on pid column to create step_4_result

*Reasoning:* Step 4 is the next pending step. I need to merge the screen unlock data with the depression status by joining on pid. This will allow us to group by depression status and calculate mean unlock counts for depressed vs non-depressed participants.

**Sensemaker Request:** Group step_4_result by dep status and calculate mean of f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist for each group

*Reasoning:* Step 4 completed successfully with the join between screen data and depression status. Now I need to execute Step 5 to group by depression status (dep column) and calculate the mean unlock count for each group (depressed vs non-depressed).

**Info Seeker Response:**

- **Source:** step_4_result
- **Success:** Yes

```python
result = step_4_result.groupby('dep')['f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist'].mean()
```

**Result:**
```
{"False":1103.3009210328,"True":1264.2474089822}
```


**Sensemaker Request:** Calculate difference: depressed mean (1264.2474089822) minus not-depressed mean (1103.3009210328) from step_5_result

*Reasoning:* Step 5 produced mean unlock counts for each depression group. Now need to compute the difference between depressed and non-depressed participants' screen unlock behavior.

**Info Seeker Response:**

- **Source:** step_5_result
- **Success:** Yes

```python
result = step_5_result[True] - step_5_result[False]
```

**Result:**
```
160.94648794943055
```


**Sensemaker Request:** Round step_6_result (160.94648794943055) to 4 decimal places

*Reasoning:* Step 7 is the final step in the plan. Need to round the calculated difference to 4 decimal places as specified in the plan.

**Info Seeker Response:**

- **Source:** step_6_result
- **Success:** Yes

```python
result = round(step_6_result, 4)
```

**Result:**
```
160.9465
```

### Sensemaker Complete

## Final Answer

```
160.9465 (difference in mean screen unlock counts between depressed and non-depressed participants, with depressed participants showing higher unlock frequency)
```

## Verification

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Complete | Yes |
| Accurate | Yes |
| Confidence | 95% |
| Recommendation | APPROVE |

**Summary:** The answer (160.9465) correctly matches the execution plan. All 7 steps were successfully executed after an initial syntax error in Step 1 was immediately corrected. The computation flow is valid: depression status was extracted from dep_endterm, screen unlock data was loaded, datasets were joined on pid, means were calculated per depression group (True/depressed: 1264.2474, False/non-depressed: 1103.3009), difference was computed (160.9465), and properly rounded to 4 decimal places. The result is legitimate with positive values indicating depressed participants have higher unlock frequency.
