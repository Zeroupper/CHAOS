Create step-by-step execution plans for data analysis queries.

RULES:
- Only use dataset names and column names from the DATASET SCHEMAS below.
- Each step output is saved as `step_N_result`. Reference it in later steps.
- Return EMPTY steps for unclear or non-analytical queries.
- If the query includes a "Hint:", use it to identify the correct datasets and columns.

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: This query requires calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate values from garmin_hr table and stress metric values from garmin_stress table for user 'test004'. The two datasets need to be joined/aligned based on timestamps that are within 1 second of each other (closest timestamp matching).

Plan Steps:

## Call 10: Union

**Timestamp:** 2026-03-16T21:36:09.270559+00:00

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: This query requires calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate values from garmin_hr table and stress metric values from garmin_stress table for user 'test004'. The two datasets need to be joined/aligned based on timestamps that are within 1 second of each other (closest timestamp matching).

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr table for user uid = 'test004' and select relevant columns (timestamp, heart_rate) (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress table for user uid = 'test004' and select relevant columns (timestamp, average_stress_intensity) (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Perform timestamp alignment by matching records where timestamps differ by <= 1 second, selecting closest pairs (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Extract heart_rate and average_stress_intensity values from aligned pairs and calculate Pearson correlation coefficient (from step_3_result)

Step States:

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: This query requires calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate values from garmin_hr table and stress metric values from garmin_stress table for user 'test004'. The two datasets need to be joined/aligned based on timestamps that are within 1 second of each other (closest timestamp matching).

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr table for user uid = 'test004' and select relevant columns (timestamp, heart_rate) (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress table for user uid = 'test004' and select relevant columns (timestamp, average_stress_intensity) (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Perform timestamp alignment by matching records where timestamps differ by <= 1 second, selecting closest pairs (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Extract heart_rate and average_stress_intensity values from aligned pairs and calculate Pearson correlation coefficient (from step_3_result)

  "affected_step": 4,
  "issue_description": "The average_stress_intensity column in garmin_stress table is completely empty (all 17283 rows have null values). This prevents calculation of the Pearson correlation coefficient as there are no stress values to correlate with heart rate data.",
  "proposed_correction": "Since average_stress_intensity contains no valid data, either: 1) Use a different stress-related metric if available in other tables, or 2) Acknowledge that the correlation cannot be calculated due to missing stress data in the garmin_stress table. Consider checking if there's an alternative stress metric available or modify the analysis to work with available data.",
  "reasoning": "The NaN result in step_4 is not due to a code error but a data quality issue. The schema shows average_stress_intensity has 17283 nulls with empty sample, meaning no actual stress intensity values exist in the dataset. This requires a plan correction rather than a code fix."

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: This query requires calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate values from garmin_hr table and stress metric values from garmin_stress table for user 'test004'. The two datasets need to be joined/aligned based on timestamps that are within 1 second of each other (closest timestamp matching).

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr table for user uid = 'test004' and select relevant columns (timestamp, heart_rate) (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress table for user uid = 'test004' and select relevant columns (timestamp, average_stress_intensity) (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Perform timestamp alignment by matching records where timestamps differ by <= 1 second, selecting closest pairs (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Extract heart_rate and average_stress_intensity values from aligned pairs and calculate Pearson correlation coefficient (from step_3_result)

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Query: This query requires calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate values from garmin_hr table and stress metric values from garmin_stress table for user 'test004'. The two datasets need to be joined/aligned based on timestamps that are within 1 second of each other (closest timestamp matching).

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr table for user uid = 'test004' and select relevant columns (timestamp, heart_rate) (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress table for user uid = 'test004' and select relevant columns (timestamp, average_stress_intensity) (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Perform timestamp alignment by matching records where timestamps differ by <= 1 second, selecting closest pairs (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Extract heart_rate and average_stress_intensity values from aligned pairs and calculate Pearson correlation coefficient (from step_3_result)

Step States:

### System Prompt

```
Execute a plan step-by-step. Respond with ONE of the provided JSON response types.

WHEN TO USE EACH TYPE:
- "execute": Use to run the next pending step or re-run a failed step with fixed instructions.
- "complete": All steps are done and results are available. Provide the final answer.
- "review": A completed step returned suspicious results (N/A, empty, NaN, unexpected values) or the initial plan cannot be followed because of unexpected results. Proposes a correction to the plan step — NOT a code fix.

RULES:
- Never compute math yourself — always use "execute".
- Steps run in order: after step N, next is N+1.
- Reference previous results as `step_N_result`.
- If a step fails with a code error, re-execute with fixed instructions (use "execute", NOT "review").
- Use "review" ONLY after a step completes but the result looks wrong due to a data issue (wrong column, bad filter). Never use "review" before a step has been attempted.
- If a step returns NaN/null after one retry, accept it and complete.
- Never use "review" on a step marked USER ACCEPTED — the user already decided to keep that value.

Based on the step results, provide the final answer.

RULES:
- "answer" must directly answer the query. State the result value first, optionally followed by one short sentence of context (e.g. "0.611 (Pearson correlation from 89 paired observations).").
- Use the value from the last computed step as the definitive result. Do NOT recompute or second-guess code correctness.
- Only answer "N/A" if a crucial step failed or returned a null/NaN value.
- "supporting_evidence" should list the key step results that support the answer.

Query: This query requires calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate values from garmin_hr table and stress metric values from garmin_stress table for user 'test004'. The two datasets need to be joined/aligned based on timestamps that are within 1 second of each other (closest timestamp matching).

Raw answer: The Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate and average_stress_intensity could not be calculated from garmin_stress table because the `average_stress_intensity` column contains all NULL values (17,283 nulls out of 17,283 records). As an alternative, the correlation between heart_rate (from garmin_hr) and BBI (from garmin_ibi) was calculated, yielding a Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.941.

Please verify the following answer against the execution plan:

Plan Understanding: This query requires calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate values from garmin_hr table and stress metric values from garmin_stress table for user 'test004'. The two datasets need to be joined/aligned based on timestamps that are within 1 second of each other (closest timestamp matching).

Plan Steps:
  Step 1: Filter garmin_hr table for user uid = 'test004' and select relevant columns (timestamp, heart_rate) (from garmin_hr)
  Step 2: Filter garmin_stress table for user uid = 'test004' and select relevant columns (timestamp, average_stress_intensity) (from garmin_stress)
  Step 3: Perform timestamp alignment by matching records where timestamps differ by <= 1 second, selecting closest pairs (from step_1_result, step_2_result)
  Step 4: Extract heart_rate and average_stress_intensity values from aligned pairs and calculate Pearson correlation coefficient (from step_3_result)

Answer: The Pearson correlation coefficient between heart_rate and average_stress_intensity could not be calculated because the average_stress_intensity column contains all NULL values. An alternative correlation between heart_rate and BBI was calculated, yielding -0.941 (Pearson correlation coefficient from overlapping data after merge).
