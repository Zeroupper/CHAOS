## Plan

**Understanding:** Analyze screen usage metrics (e.g., unlock count, duration) for participant INS-W_009 to identify patterns in phone habits.

| Step | Action | Source |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Load screen dataset | screen |
| 2 | Filter rows where pid equals 'INS-W_009' | step_1_result |
| 3 | Select key screen usage columns (e.g., f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_countepisodeunlock:14dhist, f_screen:phone_screen_rapids_sumdurationunlock:14dhist) | step_2_result |
| 4 | Calculate aggregate statistics (mean, total, trends) for screen usage metrics | step_3_result |

## Execution Log


**Sensemaker Request:** Load screen dataset from the screen table

*Reasoning:* Starting the analysis by loading the screen dataset as the first step in the plan. This will provide the raw data needed for subsequent filtering and analysis of participant INS-W_009's screen usage metrics.

**Info Seeker Response:**

- **Source:** screen
- **Success:** Yes

```python
result = screen
```

**Result:**

**Sensemaker Request:** Filter the screen dataset to only include rows where pid equals 'INS-W_009'

*Reasoning:* Step 1 successfully loaded the screen dataset. Now I need to filter for the specific participant INS-W_009 to analyze their screen usage patterns. This will narrow down the data to only the relevant participant before selecting key columns and calculating statistics.

**Info Seeker Response:**

- **Source:** screen
- **Success:** Yes

```python
result = screen[screen['pid'] == 'INS-W_009']

**Gaps:**
- Trend analysis over time was not performed as specified in Step 4 of the plan (only mean/total/min/max calculated, no temporal trends)
